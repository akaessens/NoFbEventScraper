<h3>What links can be used with this app?</h3>
<p>All facebook subdomains are supported, whether mobile (m.facebook.com) or language-specific (de-de.facebook.com). The link must contain an event ID.</p>
<h3>How to use this application?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paste button</strong>: paste a copied link from the clipboard into the URL bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Share to</strong>: Android's built-in share-function, e.g. from a browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Open with</strong>: Android's built-in open-with-function, e.g. when clicking on a link in a messenger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why does event X not work?</h3>
<p>This app relies on event information that is publicy available. If the event does not offer for example the location without a login, it will not be available in this application. Events with multiple instances are problematic because they do not provide the correct start and end date when scraping from m.facebook.com.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues with a specific event, please let me know via the <a href="https://gitreports.com/issue/akaessens/NoFbEventScraper">anonymous bugtracker</a> or at the <a href="https://github.com/akaessens/NoFbEventScraper/issues/">GitHub issue page</a>.</p>
<h3>Is this compatible with my calendar app?</h3>
<p>Yes. This application makes use of application independent calendar functions, which makes it compatible to every calendar app. However, i recommend <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ws.xsoh.etar&amp;hl=de">Etar Calendar</a> because it is Open Source.</p>
