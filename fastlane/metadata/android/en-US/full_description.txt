The purpose of this application is to get access to Facebook events without an account.
Therefore it does not use the Facebook API.
Instead it opens the Facebook event URI and downloads the website HTML code.
This source should contain the event information in form of structured data.
That data is extracted and used to create Android events.

Features:
* Does not use Facebook API
* Supports "open-with" and "share-to"
* Independent from Facebook regional sub-domain URLs
* Saves history of scraped events
* Handles upcoming events from pages
