# NoFb Event Scraper

This application was developed to be used without a facebook account.

Therefore it does not use the facebook API.
Instead it opens the facebook event URI and downloads the website source code.
This source contains the information which is used to create a calendar entry.

# Download
Currently this application is in the submitting process to FDroid. see also [#2](/../../issues/2).

Until it is published at FDroid, use [release v0.2.1](https://github.com/akaessens/NoFbEventScraper/releases/download/v0.2.1/app-release.apk).
